Why do we care?** \n","\n","Data lives in a somewhat unique place in between technology and people. **Without people there is no data.** Data is a strictly artificial (i.e., human generated) artifact, our record of facts observed and imagined. It is also artificial in another sense, in that **it can't exist without technology.** Facts that remain locked in our heads are not data. They are just thoughts and memories that have to be **encoded into data** so it can be communicated, stored, updated, and (eventually) purged altogether when we don't need it anymore. Technology is how we do do all that. Without it we are lost. \n","\n","In a real sense, understanding how data works and where it comes from gives us a peek inside how people think and, more specifically, how people make good decisions. Every ***rational*** decision involves at least four stages:\n","- A **stimulus** that prompts the need for action\n","- Collection of ***potentially* relevant facts** about alternative courses of action\n","- Development and application of **decision rationale** (models) informed by the facts and objectives\n","- Selection and **execution of a course of action** in keeping with the rationale  \n","\n","Or, to put it another way, when trying to hit a target when it really counts, you want your general approach to be Ready $\\rightarrow$ Aim $\\rightarrow$ Fire with information and intention instead of flailing about randomly in the dark with hunches based on nothing, explainable to no one.\n","\n","Good leaders can explain why they make decisions, what supporting evidence was used, and how they can be persuaded to act differently. Otherwise, why would anyone in their right minds choose to follow them? A common thread here is of course data, which allows them to formulate, communicate, and act on their decisions. \n","\n","So, if you really want to succeed in business, it is best to treat data as a critical resource on its own. Can you access it when you need it? Can you trust what it is telling you? Is it relevant to what you need to know at the time? Can you integrate it to form cohesive and coherent decisions that any rational person can agree (or disagree) with? If not, then expect lots of unfortunate suprises and in some cases outright failures. \n","\n","And where does that data reside? Hopefully, in a **database system** that has been designed to meet the specific needs of the people using it. In this lesson we will sample ideas from the lessons that follow, providing just enough information to explain where we are going and why we need to go there.   \n","\n","### TLDR for the impatient\n","> * Access to data and information are fundamental to modern business\n","> * Management is about decision making\n","> * Good decisions require information and rationale\n","> * Good information requires relevant, accurate, and timely data  \n",">\n","> $\\Rightarrow$ Important to understand how databases work and interact with business applications\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5V7nDoM1D1g-"},"source":["## **System Architecture**\n","### **Functional View: Presentation / Logic / Data**\n","\n","![Three Tiered Architecture](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L1_three_tiered_architecture.png)\n","\n","Use Cases / Business Logic / Persistent Data Stores\n","\n","SQL AS A UNIVERSAL DATA MANAGEMENT LANGUAGE"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BtUFh7tdEYdh"},"source":["### **Technical View: Networks, Operations, and Apps**\n","\n","![Enterprise Architecture](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L1_enterprise_architecture.png)\n","\n","Transaction Processing vs Analytical Processing\n","\n","User / Workgroup / Enterprise\n","\n","Files / DBMS / Services\n","\n","DBMS AS CRITICAL AND SECURE DATA REPOSITORY\n","![Glass Brick Concrete](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L1_glass_brick_concrete.jpg)\n","\n","File Attachments: The Glass House\n","\n","Direct DBMS access over https: The Brick House\n","\n","Indirect DBMS access through App Server: The Bomb Shelter\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X0Cd3iF3CG2C"},"source":["## **Data Architecture**\n","### **Data $\\rightarrow$ Information $\\rightarrow$ Knowledge**\n","Data = facts\n","\n","Information = data + metadata\n","\n","Knowledge = Information in use"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SAixkYSyINTV"},"source":["### **Data Integrity: Do really know what's in that data your company is consuming?**\n","\n","Big data is messy data\n","\n","Domain / Entity / Relational Integrity \n","\n","Maintaining integrity os an active process\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4OmXwHsRDraR"},"source":["### **Data Models ...
