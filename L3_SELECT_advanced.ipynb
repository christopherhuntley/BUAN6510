What makes this a theta join is the condition ```m1.birthYear > m2.birthYear```. \n","  \n","  Theta joins are most often used when making \"fuzzy\" matches where strict equality won't work.

It is just too easy to accidentally assign a duplicate primary key value, so why not just let the system do it for us?  \n","\n","The best practice is to use a **surrogate key** (a.k.a., \"autonumbering\")mechanism for primary key columns. Surrogate keys  generates key values as integers, starting from 1. Each time a row is added to the table the surrogate key value *incremented* by 1, causing the rows to be numbered in sequential order. The keys values are never reused. If we delete a row in the middle of the table, then the surrogate key value is deleted with it. \n","\n","We will come back to this this issue in Lesson 4, when we discuss the many different kinds of keys used in database design. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HVH3Q0HfjiZ7"},"source":["### **`JOIN ...

JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`**\n","\n","SQL joins have a *directional* component that can be useful in certain situations. Every join we have seen so far is an *inner* join, which is the default. Thus, we rarely see `INNER JOIN` used but we can if we want to be explicit about it. \n","\n","A so-called *outer* join can take on one of two directions:\n","- **Left join:** `TableA LEFT JOIN TableB` includes every row from `TableA` (to the left of the `JOIN`) and only the matching rows from `TableB` (to the right of the join).\n","- **Right join:** `TableA RIGHT JOIN Table B` is the reverse, including every row from `TableB` but only matching rows from `TableA`. \n","\n","Heads up: Some DBMSes like Google BigQuery, Oracle , and SQL Server also support a more general `FULL OUTER JOIN` syntax that combines the left and right joins, allowing every row from both tables to appear at least once. MySQL and SQLite do not support full outer joins, so **we will stick to left and right joins in this course.** \n","\n","Outer joins are often used when we allow NULL values in foreign keys.
