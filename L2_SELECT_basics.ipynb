Consider, for example, the January 2021 *Tiobe Index* of popular programming languages, where SQL is listed as #12. Every other language on the list can be used to build apps and systems. We call them general purpose languages. SQL, however, is explicitly a special purpose language, designed for data management and only data management. Of the others on the list the most similar in that respect is R. Though it is certainly possible to create apps in R, the focus is on data analysis and only data analysis. Everything else is strictly general purpose.  So, if SQL is so out of step with the rest of the programming language universe, why is it considered a critical data analytics skill? Because it does its job extremely well, of course, but there is more to it than that. \n","\n","![Tiobe Index](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L2_tiobe_index.png)\n","\n","SQL is an ancient programming language. Of the others on the list, the only one that could be considered a contemporary is C. (Assembly Language is technically not a single language but a kind of language, so it does not have an age *per se*.) Both C and SQL were developed in the late 1960s and released in the early 1970s. The others came along *decades* later. By then C and SQL were already ubiquitous, in use by millions of programmers around the world. \n","\n","Age and \"first mover advantage\" are not all of the SQL story though. Recall the three tiered model from Lesson 1? Each of the tiers are treated by the others as a black box, with internal implementation details hidden behind a *public interface* (often called an API). As long as a given tier can handle certain requests, phrased in such and such a way and producing results in specified format, then nobody has to care *how* it works. That is extremely powerful! SQL just happens to provide just such an interface. For basic CRUD operations in the data tier, SQL provides a complete and standard set of requests and responses that any application or system can rely on. Further, if a better implementation of the standards embodied by SQL comes along, we can upgrade to the newer technology without modifying *any* existing code. \n","\n","So, when asked \"Why SQL?\" the best answer is \"Why not SQL?\" because that is the right way to think of it. SQL works so well for many, many applications supported by millions of programmers. Thus, the burden of proof for an application programmer to disqualify SQL is to show that SQL can't get the job done and then propose something that does. Even then, the smart boss will instinctively ask for the same data integrity protections provided by SQL. In the end, using anything else is like swimming upstream, where relatively gentle currents on a clear day can become deadly in a storm. In other words, never assume that what works for local storage on an isolated iPhone will work for the cloud servers it connects with. The volume of data and the likelihood of corruption is just too high. Some companies, usually startups, that made the wrong choice are having to live with their decisions and ... scaling up to SQL compliance. Why not start there from the beginning? \n","\n","\n"," \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AHZRZ45sMUBw"},"source":["## **SQL History, Standards, and Use Cases**\n","\n","Structured Query Language (SQL) was developed by researchers at IBM in the early 1970s. The original name was Sequel, which is how many of us pronounce SQL to this very day. Unlike human language, programming languages have version numbers that track the evolution of the language over time. For many years, SQL was whatever IBM defined it to be, but in 1992 it was finally endorsed by the American National Standards Institute (as [SQL-92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92)). There have been newer versions over the many years since (e.g., SQL:2008 and SQL:2011) that extend the original SQL standards to include things like XML data and object-oriented concepts. We will come back to these newer features in the latter portions of this course.  \n","\n","SQL is not a full-featured language like C, C#, Java, Python, etc. Instead, it is considered a *data sublanguage* for creating and processing *relational* data and metadata. As discussed for this purpose it is ubiquitous, with support by just any programming language on earth. \n","\n","While we think of SQL as a language, the SQL *standard* defines five different kinds of language, each of which represents a different *use case*:\n","- Data Definition Language (DDL)\n","- Data Manipulation Language (DML)\n","- SQL/Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM)\n","- Transaction Control Language (TCL)\n","- Data Control Language (DCL)\n","We are going to focus on DML and DDL statements. The rest are mostly for SQL DB Administrators/Engineers.

DDL is used to create, describe, modify, or discard *metadata*: \n","- Tables, columns, etc. \n","- Relationships, keys, etc. \n","\n","DML is used to retrieve, add, update, or delete *data*:\n","- SELECT statements retrieve data from tables\n","- INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements manage the data in the tables\n","\n","In addition to DDL and DML, we will also consider a few relevant SQL/PSM, TCL, and DCL statements but always with an eye toward how they interact with DDL and DML.

The [PEP 249](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) documentation provides all the nitty gritty details. However, for our purposes, where we just want to extract data from a relational database, there are simpler ways to do it that involve less code and risk of creating bugs.\n","\n","We will assume that the final destination for the data is a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame. The pandas library (package) was among the things we imported in **Preliminaries** section above. The code looked like this:\n","```python \n","import pandas as pd\n","```\n","Pretty simple, right? The syntax even looks sort of SQL like, using `as` to specify the alias `pd` for the library name. (That actually happens a lot, with newer languages cribbing off of C and SQL for things like this.)\n","\n","When using Jupyter the easiest way to extract data from a SQL database in a is just like we've been doing it. Use `%sql` magic and then use the results in a Python code cell.

After we get a better handle on SQL we will return to pandas to see how some of these things are done, but for now we are just concerned about retrieving data from a SQL database. If you are curious how this works then refer to the [pandas IO Tools docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html), where you will find the `read_sql()` function and its cousins `read_sql_table()` and `read_sql_query()`.
