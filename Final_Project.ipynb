Further, to provide the MSBA students a head start on their Capstone projects. \n","\n","## Objectives\n","In this project you will ...\n","- Construct a data pipeline from original source files to a dimensional data warehouse\n","- Extract, translate, and load data into a normalized database of your own design\n","- Design and populate a dimensional data warehouse designed to address common analytical questions\n","- Test your databases to ensure domain, entity, relational integrity\n","- Demonstrate that the course objectives have been met  \n","- Work in small teams, sharing code and data files equally\n","\n","## Expectations\n","- Each student should be able to fully present the work of her/his team. While it is on your honor to share the load with your teammates, the instructor may ask individuals to present separately from the team in private. These private presentations will be graded separately from the rest of the team.\n","\n","## Instructions\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qErUJDI1quNQ"},"source":["__0. Form teams of 1-3 students each.__\n","\n","Use Google Sharing to share your noetbooks with your teammates. Note that while the documents (files) are shared and jointly editable, the Colab runtime is not. You will figure out what this means and figure out how to work around it. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9hS4H2FUr5JT"},"source":["__1. Gather Source Data and Frame a Analytical Problem to Address..__ \n","\n","Submit your writeup in the `1_ProjectFraming.ipynb` notebook. \n","\n","There are two options:\n","- Use the [banner data](SOMEWHERE ON GITHUB).  \n","  You will need to figure out to extract the relevant files from GitHub. \n","- Bring Your Own Data.   \n","  The source data must be nontrivial. Either of the following suffice:  \n","    - Integration from multiple data sources \n","    - One large *denormalized* dataset of least 1 million rows; if it fits in Excel or can't be normalized into at least 3 tables then it's too trivial to count. \n","\n","The problem statement should be about a decision you intend to support. For example, if using the banner data, then you could address detection of faculty workload imbalances. Are there faculty who are teaching too manhy different kinds of courses? Too many students per semester? etc. \n","\n","Then indicate how you would use the data you have collected to answer the analytical questions.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nz4ItJHHr9wJ"},"source":["__2. Design a normalized relational database that can contain all the data outlined in your framing document.

Export the ERD to a PNG file at 300 DPI. Then drop the PNG file into Google Drive and link to it in your colab notebook.

Use the table names as third level headings (`###`) and bullet lists for the column definitions. If you are feeling frisky, then perhaps use Markdown tables instead of bullet lists.  \n","- Take care with the [Markdown formatting](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Dropping big, stupidly-formatted blobs of text is very bad form.

To keep track of them all, please the prefix the table name with `import_` to indicate that the table contains raw source data.\n","- Use SQL to create and populate the tables in your ERD.

The dimension FKs are likely redundant -- they can be usually be inferred from other table relationships -- but often eliminate the need for complex JOINs.\n","- Document each fact table (and associated dimensions) as a separate ERD. Each ERD should be named using the pattern `fact-table-name.pdf` and contain no spaces or other unnecessary punctuation.

Deliver a brief walkthrough presentation of your work.__\n","\n","- You will have exactly 10 minutes to present your work. One member of your team will be selected at random to present. Everyone has to be 100% knowledgable about the project. \n","- There are no slides for presentation itself. Just walk us through your work work, notebook by notebook. What ever you do, please do not try to _sell_ your work. The purpose of the walkthrough is to review the work for completeness, relevance, and professionalism.
