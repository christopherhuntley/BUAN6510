Take a moment to read through the download page, which lists downloadable data sets along with column names and data types.\n","\n","In keeping with the Movies Tonight case, we will focus on `title.basics.tsv.gz`, `names.basics.tsv.gz`, and `title.principals.tsv.gz` files. Some notes:\n","- `titles`, `names`, and `principals` are equivalent to movies, artists, and credits in the Movies Tonight database.  \n","- The `.tsv` file extension means that the files are in tab separated values (TSV) format, an ancient cousin to the more common CSV format. In the days before everybody pulled up data sets into a spreadsheet to explore their contents, data was something you would edit in a text editor (note: MS Word is not a text editor). The tabs forced the data to appear in columns, for the most part. \n","- The `.gz` file extension indicates that the data has been compressed using the `gzip` utility. In this case the compression is about 5 to 1. \n","\n","**As you are exploring draw an ERD to represent the design of the database.** (No, there is not need to submit it.
