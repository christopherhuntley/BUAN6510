We see this in database design most starkly. While the relational model defines domains and codomains, it does not actualy address data types. ER diagrams can model concepts that can't actually be implemented in relational databases without a translation step. Even the rigorous laws of the normalization process come with plenty of exceptions to allow for special cases. We can define even more normal forms but at some point it just makes sense to get on with implementation. \n","\n","Now it is finally time to put all those details back in. There is a lot more to SQL than just `SELECT` queries!\n","\n","SQL is both a language and a platform. The language is a place for logical design. We create tables and define all the necessary rules to keep our data clean and informative. We then use yet more SQL to populate and maintain the tables. That's all built into the SQL language and is for the most part derived from the Relational Data Model. \n","\n","The SQL platform is 100% about implementation. Where does the data reside? How is it backed up? Who has access to the data and what are they allowed to do once they get there? These things are also supported in the SQL language, *even though they are technically not part of the Relational Database Model*. \n","\n","In this lesson we will cover SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements needed to implement a database design. But first, we will review some of the logical design details we didn't cover in module 3. \n"," "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NekcmKiCsxQm"},"source":["---\n","## **Logical Design Decisions**\n","\n","In this section we review a few logical design issues with SQL code implications.\n","\n","What's logical design again? Didn't we already cover that? \n","\n","Logical design is about making decisions that **may be difficult to undo afterwards.** Before we incur the technical debt $-$ note that debt here is not about money but having options $-$ we want to be very sure that we have the conceptual requirements correct. Logical design goes past that, finally spending the techncial capital we have built up through our conceptual design work.\n","\n","### **Coding Conventions**\n","> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton\n","\n","In order to minimize typo bugs and reduce the mental burden for SQL users, it is important to always follow a consistent naming convention. It should be possible to *just know* if a query has a typo bug or a given column is likely to be spelled a certain way without having to read documentation. That's where conventions come into play. \n","\n","In the old days when most SQL coders were coming from COBOL or Fortran backgrounds, most developers followed naming conventions like:\n","- Table names in `ALL_CAPS`\n","- Column names in `Initial_Caps`\n","- Short but descriptive names for everything, like variables in another language\n","- All table and columns names in the singular form\n","\n","However, as the old languages died out, SQL coders began to ignore the old naming conventions in favor of a style more like what they were used to:\n","- Table names with `Initial_Caps` (or `no_caps_at_all`)\n","- Column names in `lower_case_letters`\n","- Longer table names, especially in big databases with *thousands* of tables\n","- Collective (plural) table names and scalar (singular) column names\n","\n","Names are important but not all of the story here. Coding *style* matters too. By being consistent and intentional, we can actually eliminate bugs! Some examples:\n","- Use uppercase for SQL keywords like `SELECT` or `AS`. This makes it clear what parts of a statement are syntax versus names of things. That way the next coder will know where to look for typos. \n","- Avoid long lines of text. Instead, break statements into logical chunks (e.g., clauses in a `SELECT` query), one line at a time. Use indentation to indicate that a statement continues onto the next line. \n","- When choosing data types, always prefer the standard ones over vendor-specific ones *unless* there is a major performance of other benefit and you don't mind being locked into a specific vendor's products forever.\n","\n","For what it's worth, there are [style guides](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/) that dictate many of these rules so we don't have to decide.

That's a matter of preference, however. \n","- **Create indexes for selected non-key columns to allow fast lookups?** The advantage is speed but the storage costs for the indexes can be significant.

However, this practice affects readability of the code and, further, can cause seemingly nonsensical errors when a code forgets the trailing backtick on a name. It's an easy mistake; just typing a quote where you meant to have a backtick can cause lots of code immediately after the quote to become invisible to the SQL interpreter.

It's a relatively expensive but necessary operation. However, when we delete data from an indexed column, there is almost harm to just leaving the data in the index, skipping over it instead of deleting it. That avoid the cost of updating the index. \n","\n","We call ths sort of thing a **soft delete**. A soft delete marks data for deletion at a later time, when it won't delay more important and timely operations. It is often quicker to delete lots of things at once than to delete them one at a time. \n","\n","At some point however, soft deletes can make our tables like an episode of *Hoarders*, with lots of leftover artifacts to navigate around. Everything then grinds to halt. \n","\n","Vacuuming is the process of rebuilding an index (or sometimes a whole table) to eliminate all the soft deletes. For a large database, this process may take a while. This is the kind of thing a database administrator will schedule for the middle of the night when it will affect the fewest users. \n","\n","Vacuuming out stale data is implemented in various ways, depending on the vendor. However, both PostreSQL and SQLite support a one line SQL command that handles all tables in the database.\n","\n","```sql\n","VACUUM;\n","```\n","\n","### **Metadata Queries**\n","One of the convenient features of SQL is that **databases contain their own metadata about themselves**. This allows a lot of this structural information to be accessed in SQL queries. \n","\n","Unfortunately, how to access the metadata varies from vendor to vendor. For example:\n","- In MySQL, information about tables, columns, etc. is kept in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database. The user has to be granted permissions to it like any other database. Alternatively, if we want a list of tables in the current database, we can use the MySQL-specific `SHOW TABLES` and `DESCRIBE` statements. \n","- In SQLite, we can use the `pragma.table_info()` function within a `SELECT` statements to get information about the columns of a specific. To get a list of all tables, we query the `sqlite_master` table.  \n","\n","### **Dump Files**\n","Databases systems are not like other software you may have encourntered before. They are **always** reading and writing from/to storage. Thus, making a backup is not simply a matter of shutting down the DBMS and copying some files. That would both take the applications they support offline and possibly corrupt data. \n","\n","Instead, the DBMS provides a way to export the current state of the database to disk as a *dump file*. A dump file is a (possibly very very long) list of SQL statements that recreate the database. These files an then be archived like any other file. If needed the database can be loaded (or reloaded) from a dump file. \n","\n","Since dump files are written in SQL, this gives the database administrator the ability to rewrite the SQL when migrating the data from one SQL dialect to another. So, if Oracle does things differently from Microsoft SQL Server, then the SQL syntax, data types, etc. in the dump files are adjusted accordingly. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DKpvT0vaTrwH"},"source":["---\n","## **Movies Tonight, Part 3**\n","\n","We continue the Movies Tonight case by converting the ERD and relations into SQLite DDL code.

If that's not you, then just try to follow along with the concepts in bold without worrying too much about the coding details. \n","\n","SQLAlchemy is more than just a database engine, however. It can also be used for **object relational mapping (ORM)**. ORM is a solution to the **impedance mismatch** problem in object oriented languages like Java, C#, or Python. In object oriented languages things like entities and relationships are represented by software objects. These objects are defined in similar fashion to relational entities but can include functionality (methods) as well as data. The code is written in **object classes**, which can be instantiated as **object instances** in code. (That's just like how a table represents an entity class but each row represents an entity instance.)\n","\n","**So, if the programmer has to define object classes anyway, why do it yet again in SQL code? After all, that's just one more thing to have to keep track of as they are developing their code.** ORM makes it so they don't have to. Instead they create *mappings* called *schema* that translate their software objects into equivalent SQL code. \n","\n","In SQLAlchemy, the programmers extend a special `Base` class in their Python code that automatically translates (maps) from objects to tables (and back again):\n","\n","```python\n","# Define the Movie schema\n","class Movie(Base):\n","    __tablename__ = 'movies'\n","    id = Column('movie_id', Integer(), primary_key=True, nullable=False),\n","    title = Column('title', String(100),  nullable=False),\n","    rating = Column('rating', String(5))\n","\n","  def __repr__(self):\n","        return \"<Movie(id='%i', title='%s', rating='%s')>\" % (self.id, self.title, self.rating)\n","\n","```\n","\n","The programmers can then ignore SQL for the most part, creating and using their software objects as they choose. Then, when needed they can **persist** (store) objects in the database for retrieval later. SQL is generated as needed behind the scenes.  \n","\n","```python\n","# A session object represents a series of database transactions\n","from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n","Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n","session = Session()\n","\n","# create a new movie object \n","movie = Movie(title='Big Night',rating ='PG-13')\n","\n","# queue it up for insertion into the database; this generates a SQL query\n","session.add(movie)\n","\n","# run the necessary SQL queries to sync the objects \n","session.commit()\n","\n","# retrieve a copy of the movie from the database\n","movie2 = session.query(Movie).filter_by(title = 'Big Night').first()\n","\n","# calls the __repr__ method before printing\n","print(movie2)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qVL7n_Rys_95"},"source":["---\n","## **Congratulations!
